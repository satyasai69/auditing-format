# About the project / Documentation

_Summary of the project. The more documentation, the better._

# Stats

_Use something like solidity metrics or cloc to get these._

- nSLOC: XX
- Complexity Score: XX
- Security Review Timeline: Date -> Date

# Setup

## Requirements

_What tools are needed to setup the codebase & test suite?_

Example:

```bash
forge init
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
forge install vectorized/solady --no-commit
forge build
```

## Testing

_How to run tests. How to see test coverage._

Example:

```bash
forge test
```

# Security Review Scope

_The specific details of the security review. Nail down exactly what the protocol is planning on deploying, and how they plan on deploying it._

## Commit Hash

## Repo URL

## In scope vs out of scope contracts

## Compatibilities

- Solc Version: XXX
- Chain(s) to deploy contract to:
  - XXX (ie: ETH)
  - XXX (ie: Arbitrum)
- Tokens:
  - XXX (ie: ERC20s)
    - XXX (ie: LINK: <address>)
    - XXX (ie: USDC: <address>)
  - XXX (ie: ERC721s)
    - XXX (ie: CryptoKitties: <address>)
  - _List expected ERC20s and other specific tokens. If a protocol is expected to work with multiple or any tokens of a certain standard, you could do something like "All ERC20s". Or an ordered list like "USDC: <USDC Address>" etc_

# Roles

_What are the different actors of the system? What are their powers? What should/shouldn't they do?_

Example:
â€‹

```
Actors:
    Buyer: The purchaser of services, in this scenario, a project purchasing an audit.
    Seller: The seller of services, in this scenario, an auditor willing to audit a project.
    Arbiter: An impartial, trusted actor who can resolve disputes between the Buyer and Seller.
    The Arbiter is only compensated the arbiterFee amount if a dispute occurs.
```

# Known Issues

_List any issues that the protocol team is aware of and will not be acknowledging/fixing._
